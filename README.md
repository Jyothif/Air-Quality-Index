## Data Collection
I have used web scraping for collecting the data


### What is Web scraping
* Web scraping is the technique by which we can collect the data from any website. 
* The web scraping software may access the data while web scraping can be done manually by the software tool.

* Collected the data which is based on clamatic conditions of a certain regions. I have grabbed few cities data for analysis.

* In this upload I have scrapped the data from url:http://en.tutiempo.net/climate and collected data in Html format.
